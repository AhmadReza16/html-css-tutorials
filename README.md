# Bro Code HTML & CSS Tutorials – Practice Code

This repository contains my personal practice while following the  
**Bro Code HTML & CSS tutorial series** on YouTube.

📁 The folders are grouped by video ranges (e.g. 1–10, 11–20, ...),  
and each subfolder contains the code I wrote while following that specific video.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is **only for learning purposes**. I’m uploading the code I wrote while watching and coding along with the videos.  
This helps me track my progress and review what I’ve learned step by step.

## 🛠️ Notes

- These are **not original projects**; they’re for **educational use only**.
- I upload a few sections each day as I watch and practice more of the tutorials.
- In the future, I may also build my own projects using what I learned here.
