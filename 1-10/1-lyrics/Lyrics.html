            You are my fire
            The one desire
            Believe when I say
            I want it that way

            But we are two worlds apart
            Can't reach to your heart
            When you say
            That I want it that way

            Tell me why
            Ain't nothing but a heartache
            Tell me why
            Ain't nothing but a mistake
            Tell me why
            I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way

            Am I your fire
            Your one desire
            Yes I know it's too late
            But I want it that way

            Tell me why
            Ain't nothing but a heartache
            Tell me why
            Ain't nothing but a mistake
            Tell me why
            I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way

            Now I can see that we've fallen apart
            From the way that it used to be, yeah
            No matter the distance
            I want you to know
            That deep down inside of me

            Your are my fire
            The one desire
            You are, you are, you are, you are
            Don't wanna hear you say ...

            Ain't nothing but a heartache
            Ain't nothing but a mistake
            I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way

            Tell me why
            Ain't nothing but a heartache
            Tell me why
            Ain't nothing but a mistake
            Tell me why
            I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way

            Tell me why...
            Ain't nothing but a heartache
            Ain't nothing but a mistake
            Tell me why
            I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way
            Cos' I want it that way
